Review
This submission demonstrates a comprehensive approach to completing the AWS VPC Mini Project. The student accurately follows the instructor's instructions, documenting each step with clear screenshots and explanations. Below is a detailed evaluation:

1. Strengths:

Clarity: The student provides well-structured content with detailed steps, annotated screenshots, and comments for each task. The document is logically organized, which makes it easy to follow.
Completeness: All stages of the VPC setup, including CIDR assignment, subnet configuration, gateway deployments, route table updates, and VPC peering connections, are thoroughly documented, fulfilling the instructor requirements.
Visuals: High-quality screenshots are included at every stage to validate successful implementation. Steps are visually verified, aiding understanding even for beginners.
Best Practices: The inclusion of security and networking best practices demonstrates the student's understanding of cloud architecture beyond the immediate project requirements.
2. Weaknesses:

While the screenshots confirm the successful execution of tasks, the documentation could benefit from the inclusion of AWS CLI commands for an alternative approach, as mentioned in the submission requirements. This would have showcased a more well-rounded understanding of cloud infrastructure management.
The reflection does not explicitly indicate testing scenarios (e.g., verifying communication between peered VPCs or confirming private subnet access through NAT Gateway), which could improve the technical depth of the documentation.
Component Scores:

VPC Creation: Fulfilled with a valid CIDR block and a clear visual demonstration. (10/10)
Subnet Configuration: Public and private subnets are created, associated with availability zones, and assigned appropriate CIDRs. (15/15)
Internet Gateway Setup: The gateway is properly attached to the VPC as shown. (10/10)
Routing Table: Route tables for both public and private subnets are configured successfully for internet access and peering connections. (15/15)
NAT Gateway: NAT Gateway is implemented correctly with routing supporting private subnet access to the internet. (15/15)
VPC Peering: Peering connection between two VPCs is completed with evidence of communication via updated route tables. (20/20)
Documentation & Screenshots: The document contains annotated screenshots and clear instructions, meeting the requirements. However, CLI commands could have been included for broader coverage. (13/15)
Overall Observations: This project meets nearly all the instructor's requirements, showcasing competence in configuring AWS VPCs and establishing secure cloud networking. The student demonstrates awareness of industry best practices, boosting the relevance of the solution provided.
